            Like taking an asteroid by the crater, we had to find a way to face the <span className="purple">challenges</span> met when trying to implement our graphics and interactions.
            <br />

            <br />
            <ul>
              <li className="about-activity">
                <ImPointRight /> How do we connect the user to the game?
              </li>
              <br />
              We set up the server using <span className="purple">Unity Relay</span> and hosted the client via <span className="purple">WebGL</span>, allowing each player to join using their <span className="purple">mobile devices</span>. Unity Relay handles multiplayer connections, while WebGL hosting enables the client to run directly in the browser, so players just open the webpage to jump into the gameâ€”<span className="purple">no app needed</span>. Players control movement by tilting their phones.
              <br />

              <br />
              <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> How do we create a parallax effect in a space setting?
              </li>
              <br />
              Since players are not actually moving forwards, we simulate movement by instantiating a <span className="purple">cylindrical</span> shape <span className="purple">repeatedly</span> in specific intervals where asteroids are randomely distributed on its surface. Each set of cylindrical objects is then transformed towards the player over time and is subsequently destroyed to save memory once it passes the player. 
              <br />

              <br />
              <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> How do we make a game session a fulfilling and enjoyable experience? 
              </li>
              <br />
              By adding <span className="purple">engaging mechanics</span> like asteroid shooting, pickup items, and multiplayer features, players enjoy friendly competition and teamwork. <span className="purple">Richer interactions</span>, like tilting or shaking their phones, bring strategy and excitement, making the experience lively and memorable for everyone.<br />
            </ul>
            <br />
