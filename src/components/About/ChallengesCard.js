            Like taking an asteroid by the crater, we had to find a way to face the <span className="purple">challenges</span> met when trying to implement our graphics and interactions.
            <br />

            <br />
            <ul>
              <li className="about-activity">
                <ImPointRight /> How do we connect the user to the game?
              </li>
              <br />
              We set up the server using <span className="purple">Unity Relay</span> and hosted the client via <span className="purple">WebGL</span>, allowing each player to join using their <span className="purple">mobile devices</span>. Unity Relay handles multiplayer connections, while WebGL hosting enables the client to run directly in the browser, so players just open the webpage to jump into the gameâ€”<span className="purple">no app needed</span>. Players control movement by tilting their phones.
              In order to appreciate these graphics, the user has to <span className="purple">interact</span> somehow, so what kind of ways can the user interact?
              <br />

              <br />
              <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> How do we create a parallax effect in a space setting?
              </li>
              <br />
